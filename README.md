# RPA Testing
 #**Description:**
 
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) refers to the use of technology to mimic human tasks in the
same way that a person would execute a process. 

The following code represent a RPA system created.


In this case, the desired output would be a new record being displayed on the web
application once the item has been added. This would resort in a highly repetitive process which is automated using RPA.

To test the solution:
The webApp at: https://connectedoffice-devicemanagement.azurewebsites.net/ is used to run solution.


|Branching     |

 provided through submission.
 
  #**Use:**
 The RPA can be accessed at link: https://github.com/chriszeymar/CMPG-323-Project-4---34946039 by allowed users.
 
 The UIpath support is embedded in code so the link automatically.
 UIpath provides a structured look for testing purposes. 
 
  #**Steps to test solution:**
  
  1. Run Login activity to get access into domain.
  
  2. Run Read/Write activity which confirms read by message box then populates the webApp
  
  3. Run Delete Activity reboot or format all 3 domains. Delete sequence works on as stack, with FIFO principple.
  
  4. Run Last sequence to update test result.
  
  **N.B** All sequences can run consequently.
